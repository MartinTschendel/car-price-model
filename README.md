# car-price-model
a linear regression model to predict car prices

This small project is based on chapter 2 "Machine learning" for regression" of Alexey Grigorevs book "Machine Learning Bookcamp" and uses kaggle's car dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset).


On 2020-08-17, I used scikit learn to train the model. The notebook is uploaded and has the filename 200817-car-scikit.ipynb
