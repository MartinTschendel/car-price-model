# car-price-model
a linear regression model to predict car prices

This small project is based on chapter 2 "Machine learning" for regression" of Alexey Grigorevs book "Machine Learning Bookcamp" and uses kaggle's car dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/cardataset).

On 2020-08-17, I used scikit learn to train the model. The notebook is uploaded and has the filename 200817-car-scikit.ipynb

## Additional simple linear regression model

- I also added one simple linear regression model built with scikit-learn for the prediction of salaries based on the years of experience taken from the course "Machine Learning A-Z" (Udemy))
- the model can be found here in this repository: 201027-LinearRegression-Salaries.ipynb

## Additional multiple linear regression model

- I also added one multiple linear regression model built with scikit-learn for the prediction of startup profits based on multiple feature variables taken from the course "Machine Learning A-Z" (Udemy))
- the model can be found here in this repository: 201030-MultLinReg-Startups.ipynb
- the dataset can be found here in this repository: 50_Startups.csv
