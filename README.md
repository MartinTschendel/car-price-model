# car-price-model
a linear regression model to predict car prices

This small project is based on chapter 2 "Machine learning" for regression" of Alexey Grigorevs book "Machine Learning Bookcamp". 

## Additional linear regression model

- I also added one simple linear regression model built with scikit-learn for the prediction of salaries based on the years of experience taken from the course "Machine Learning A-Z" (Udemy))
- the model can be found here in this repository: 201027-LinearRegression-Salaries.ipynb
